      <h2>Projects are fun. Get one!</h2>
      <p1>Dont let me have all of the fun. My cars might seem like too big of a task for 
          some people but I didnt start here. I started with paying cash for a cheap 
          reliable truck. I was determined to learn how to fix everything it would need 
          and with very few exceptions I did. Check out this quick video by Zack over 
          at Donut Media.</p1>

        <p2>Zack showed you a bunch of great options but left out trucks. In my opinion 
            they are the easiest vehicles to work on. Ive had some older trucks that Ive 
            climbed up in the front with the engine while I was working on it.</p2>
