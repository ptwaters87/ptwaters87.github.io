    <p1>Ive got 2 projects that Im working right now. The primary project is a 1979 Camaro. It is the car I drive to work every day. 
       I call it my primary project because its the one at the house and gets worked on most often. My other project is a 1959 Chevy 1ton 
       pickup truck. The truck is out at the family farm waiting for some good TLC. I like the truck more but becuase of that I also 
       only do high dollar work on it. Thats why its not at the house. I never have money to do restoration work on something that old. 
       But while Im waiting for time and money to work on the truck I get a lot done on the camaro.

       The camaro has a 5.3 LS swap from a Silverado bolted to the original th350 transmisson. Ive done all of the rough work on the 
       engine swap but it still needs the finishing touches. The rear differential has a mini spool so the fat rear tires can find 
       as much traction as possible. The next job coming up is a high stall torque converter and shift kit for the trans. I should 
       be able to keep the engine around its 325hp potential better with these parts. In the future I will be installing a better camshaft 
       and some higher flowing heads. Forced induction is something I am considering but I have not made up my mind. Options would be
       Supercharger, Turbo Kit, or continue building a high horsepower naturally aspirated engine.

       The truck started with a 235 inline six and 4 speed trans. When I got it the trans was locked up and after hours of work I was only 
       able to get the engine to run for a minute. Years ago I decided I wanted to swap in a diesel driveline to give it more of a work truck
       feel so it got a 7.3l idi engine and zf5 trans. I was able to get everything set up and drove the truck but I nevery really put 
       the finishing touches on it. I spent some time out of the country and then money was tight so the truck went out to the farm. 
       Now Im back at the project and it is getting a fresh set of legs. The cab will be swapped onto a Silverado so it will have a reliable
       driveline and brakes. When it has a good comfortable setup to work with, it will get suspension upgrades and maybe in the future I will
       come back to the diesel engine idea.
